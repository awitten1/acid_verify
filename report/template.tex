\section{Introduction}

A core feature that database systems provide are ACID transactions.
ACID transactions enable application developers to build their applications
without worrying about race conditions on their data.

Unfortunately, many database providers fail to provide the consistency guarantees that they
claim to provide.  The Jepsen project \cite{b1} has found that
many popular, industry strength systems have failed to provide ACID.  It would therefore benefit
users if databases could cryptographically prove that they provide ACID.


\section{Background}
\subsection{Database Transaction}

Users of a database system submit transactions to the database system.  A transaction
is a sequence of reads and writes.  High performance systems run many transations concurrently from
many clients. Database systems provide ACID transactions. In this paper, we focus only on the Isolation property.
Isolation means that the database system provides a property called \textit{Serializability}.
Serializability means that transactions appear to execute sequentially
(even though the system may in reality run them concurrently).

In particular, suppose we have transactions
\(T_1,T_2,...,T_n\) running in the system.  Each \(T_i\) may be thought of as a function operating on the database
$T_i\colon D\rightarrow D$ (where \(D\) is the set of possible database states).  Serializability means that if \(d_{initial}\) is the inital state of the database
and \(d_{final}\) is the final state of the database, then $d_{final} = \left( T_{\pi(1)} \circ \dots \circ T_{\pi(n)} \right) \left( d_{initial} \right)$ where \(\pi\)
is a some permutation \cite{b2}.

This property is extremely value to developers because it allows developers to maintain invariants on their data.  If each $T_i$ maintains
an invariant, then the composition of them do as well.  For example client A may write a transaction transferring \$100 from user A to user B.
That transaction maintains the invariant that the total amount of money has stayed the same.  Client B might at the same time
write a transaction computing the total amount of money across all users.  Serializability guarantees that client B observes
the correct amount of money.

It is therefore paramount that database systems actually provide Isolation.  Failures to do so can (and will) lead to
application bugs (more doctors on call at the same time than is necessary \cite{b5}) or even security vulnerabilities \cite{b6}.
Despite their importance, database providers for one reason or another (bugs or deliberately) fail to provide the isolation levels
that users request.  Making matters worse, users usually have little or no ability to detect when a database provider has failed
to provide Serializability.  The goal of this work is to provide cryptographic proof that Serializability has been provided.

\subsection{Merkle Trees}

This work depends heavily on Merkle Trees. We therefore review Merkle Trees here and describe which properties we depend on.

\section{Related Work}
There is related work such as zkSQL \cite{b3} and vSQL \cite{b4} for providing authenticated answers
to ad-hoc SQL queries.  This involves providing ZK-proofs of particular SQL operators (such as hash join and filter operators) and composing those proofs.
A recent system LitmusDB \cite{b3} set out to solve
